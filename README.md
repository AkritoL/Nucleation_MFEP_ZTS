# Nucleation_MFEP_ZTS
Nucleation in multicomponent mixtures, requiring an energy barrier, is difficult to capture with numerical tools. Using the string method, we identify two mechanisms in ternary mixtures and find that their nucleation barriers and pathways can be tuned by adjusting surface tensions.
